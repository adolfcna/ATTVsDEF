# Red Team & Blue Team Operations Cheat Sheet
This project provides a concise and actionable cheat sheet tailored for professionals involved in cybersecurity offensive (Red Team) and defensive (Blue Team) operations. It serves as a quick reference guide to enhance security assessments, incident response, and tactical decision-making.

## Command References
Essential commands for tools like Metasploit, Cobalt Strike, Empire, PowerShell, Sysinternals, and more.
Blue Team logs and detections using Splunk, ELK Stack, Wireshark, etc.

## TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)
Mapped to MITRE ATT&CK framework for Red Team activities.
Defensive mapping for Blue Team countermeasures.

## Common Scenarios
How to perform privilege escalation, lateral movement, and persistence.
How to detect and mitigate these threats.
Tool Integration:

Cheat sheets for widely used Red Team tools (e.g., Nmap, BloodHound, Nessus).
Defensive monitoring with SIEMs and EDR solutions (e.g., CrowdStrike, SentinelOne).

## Incident Response Tips
Steps to handle alerts triggered by Red Team activities.
Key log sources and artifacts to review.
Target Audience:
Red Team Operators seeking a quick reference for stealthy and efficient attack methods.
Blue Team Analysts and Incident Responders aiming to improve their detection and mitigation strategies.
SOC Teams, Penetration Testers, and Ethical Hackers looking for a compact and effective guide.

## Value
This cheat sheet bridges the gap between offensive and defensive operations, fostering a better understanding of attack and defense mechanisms. Itâ€™s an invaluable tool for security teams striving to simulate and counter threats effectively.



## The Goal
The goal of this project is simple - read other researchers work, execute some common/uncommon attacking techniques in a lab environment, do my own reasearch and:

* understand how various cyber attacks and techniques can be executed and how they work
* learn about how malware is written
* write code to further understand the tools and techniques used by attackers and malware authors
* learn more about C++, Windows internals and Windows APIs
* see what artifacts the techniques and tools leave behind on the endpoint
* try out various industry tools for pentesting, coding, debugging, reverse engineering, malware analysis, and become more profficient in using them
* take notes for future reference
