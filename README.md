## The Goal

The goal of this project is simple - read other researchers work, execute some common/uncommon attacking techniques in a lab environment, do my own reasearch and:

* understand how various cyber attacks and techniques can be executed and how they work
* learn about how malware is written
* write code to further understand the tools and techniques used by attackers and malware authors
* learn more about C++, Windows internals and Windows APIs
* see what artifacts the techniques and tools leave behind on the endpoint
* try out various industry tools for pentesting, coding, debugging, reverse engineering, malware analysis, and become more profficient in using them
* take notes for future reference
